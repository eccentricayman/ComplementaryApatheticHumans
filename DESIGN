Project:
This project is a terminal based version of Cards Against Humanity, a popular card game involving multiple white cards, 
with phrases on them being used to fill in the blank for a black card. All players start out with 10 white cards.
The Card Czar is the person who created the game; he holds the black card, and decides which 
white card combined with his black card has the funniest phrase. The person who has the funniest phrase becomes the 
Card Czar next turn, and everyone else gets one more white card. The game ends when someone out of white cards.

UI:
The project will be used through the terminal; a player can create a game or search for existing ones. There are minimum 4
players per game. Once the game starts, each person will get a list of their white cards, and the card czar will get his
black card. Once every person has entered a number (corresponding to a card) into their terminal, the Card Czar and the players
will have each phrase show up on their screen. Once they all print, the card czar will choose the funniest, and it will display
that phrase plus the one who's white card created it. Everybody else will get a white card, and that person will start as a 
card czar. Throughout the game, players can speak to the entire group, just having a single line message print to everyones'
terminals.
